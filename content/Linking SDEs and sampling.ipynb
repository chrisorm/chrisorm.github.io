    "In bayesian inference, when we want to find samples from an intractable posterior distribution, we often resort to sampling schemes like Metropolis-Hastings or Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. It can seem like a bit of black box as to how this actually works - but there is a powerful intuition to be gained by considering stochastic processes.\n",

It also can be interesting to look at what we can add from other areas - for example, stochastic gradient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo is where we use an estimate of the gradient rather than its full form. See the paper for more details, but you may also want to check out [Monte Carlo Gradient Estimation in Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.10652) for some ways we could compute estimates of this gradient."
